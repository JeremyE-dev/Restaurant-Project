# Restaurant-Project
Create a website for a fictional restaurant - project for Software Guild Intro to Web Development Course

Current Bugs:
- Footer on home page not strecting across page since adding bootstap components
               - attempted to add padding on either side, which fixed same issue with Navbar
               - attempted moving outside og body elemen, adjusting margins
               - Footer was streched prior to addind 
- Footer on Menu page floatong above bottom of page since adding Bootstap components
               - Initially used fxed footer, but was not responsive to different window/screen sizes
               - reviewed sources such as freecodecamp, and experimented with adding padding 
               - Attempted adjusting padding and margins both inline and on external style sheets
               - This also occured after adding bootstrap element to other sections of the page.
- Nav Buttons - visited button not changing background color after visiting, hovered button text not in bold since updating bootstrap                     components
              - These items functioned prior when using Navbar and pill-badge buttons from CSS Lesson
              - For the current version: Bootstrap Navbar was used with new class names, attempted to add CSS to internal style sheet to                   implement the styling via na a:hover and same for visted. attempted inline styling to see iff adding inline command would                 take precedence
              - I reviewed Bootstrap doumentation, CODE-AlONGs from class and online resources like StackOverflow
              - I suspect I ned to learn abit more of how to implement CSS styling techniques to pre-defined Bootstrap component.
